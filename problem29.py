'''
Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings.
The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character.
For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".
Implement run-length encoding and decoding.
You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters.
You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.

def encode(input):
    '''
    When encoding a given string, iterate over the string and find repeated characters.
    When we encounter a change in characters, pick up the last character and append to output.
    Else, increment the counter and go on.
    After complete iteration, we are left with the last character (since we can't find a 'changed' state)
    For this, simply pick up the character and counter, and append to the output.

# Test Cases

## Encoding
assert encode("AAAABBBCCDAA") == "4A3B2C1D2A"       # Example
assert encode("ABCD") == "1A1B1C1D"                 # Single Counters
assert encode("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCD") == "15A1B1C1D"  # Double digit Counter
assert encode("") == ""                             # Edge

## Decoding
assert decode("4A3B2C1D2A") == "AAAABBBCCDAA"       # Example
assert decode("1A1B1C1D") == "ABCD"                 # Single Counters
assert decode("15A1B1C1D") == "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCD"  # Double digit Counter
assert decode("") == ""                             # Edge

## Encoding + Decoding
assert "AAAABBBCCDAA" == decode(encode("AAAABBBCCDAA"))
assert "ABCD" == decode(encode("ABCD"))
assert "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCD" == decode(encode("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCD"))
assert "" == decode(encode(""))
