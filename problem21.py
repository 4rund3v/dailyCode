Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

# Example
assert minRoomsRequired([(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)]) == 2

# Distinct lectures, single classroom
assert minRoomsRequired([(0, 10), (10, 20), (20, 30)]) == 1

assert minRoomsRequired([(1, 50), (2, 50), (3, 50), (4, 55)]) == 4

# Reusing classes
