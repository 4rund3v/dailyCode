# Problem 468 
Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
you should return:

[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
Follow-up: What if you couldn't use any extra space?


# Problem 461
There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

Right, then down
Down, then right
Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.


# Problem 425
You are presented with an 8 by 8 matrix representing the positions of pieces on a chess board. The only pieces on the board are the black king and various white pieces. Given this matrix, determine whether the king is in check.

For details on how each piece moves, see here.

For example, given the following matrix:

...K....
........
.B......
......P.
.......R
..N.....
........
.....Q..
You should return True, since the bishop is attacking the king diagonally.


# Problem 423
The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix M, where M[i][j] == 1 if there is a path between vertices i and j, and otherwise 0.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
The transitive closure of this graph would be:

[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
Given a graph, find its transitive closure.


# Problem 392
You are given a 2D matrix of 1s and 0s where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally orvertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

An island is a group is cells connected horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. There is guaranteed to be exactly one island in this grid, and the island doesn't have water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island. Each cell has a side length of 1.

Determine the perimeter of this island.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 0]]
Return 14.


# Problem 352
A typical American-style crossword puzzle grid is an N x N matrix with black and white squares, which obeys the following rules:

Every white square must be part of an "across" word and a "down" word.
No word can be fewer than three letters long.
Every white square must be reachable from every other white square.
The grid is rotationally symmetric (for example, the colors of the top left and bottom right squares must match).
Write a program to determine whether a given matrix qualifies as a crossword grid.


# Problem 341
You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

It can be found in the dictionary
It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the board
The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not diagonally).
Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }
and matrix:

[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]
Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and 'rat' without them touching each other. We could have alternatively made 'eat' and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.


# Problem 315
In linear algebra, a Toeplitz matrix is one in which the elements on any given diagonal from top left to bottom right are identical.

Here is an example:

1 2 3 4 8
5 1 2 3 4
4 5 1 2 3
7 4 5 1 2
Write a program to determine whether a given input is a Toeplitz matrix.


# Problem 302
You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either /, \, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:

\    /
 \  /
  \/
Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return 3.


# Problem 267
You are presented with an 8 by 8 matrix representing the positions of pieces on a chess board. The only pieces on the board are the black king and various white pieces. Given this matrix, determine whether the king is in check.

For details on how each piece moves, see here.

For example, given the following matrix:

...K....
........
.B......
......P.
.......R
..N.....
........
.....Q..
You should return True, since the bishop is attacking the king diagonally.


# Problem 255
The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix M, where M[i][j] == 1 if there is a path between vertices i and j, and otherwise 0.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
The transitive closure of this graph would be:

[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
Given a graph, find its transitive closure.


# Problem 195
Let A be an N by M matrix in which every row and every column is sorted.

Given i1, j1, i2, and j2, compute the number of elements of M smaller than M[i1, j1] and larger than M[i2, j2].

For example, given the following matrix:

[[1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20],
 [2, 6, 9, 14, 22, 25],
 [3, 8, 10, 15, 25, 30],
 [10, 11, 12, 23, 30, 35],
 [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]]
And i1 = 1, j1 = 1, i2 = 3, j2 = 3, return 15 as there are 15 numbers in the matrix smaller than 6 or greater than 23.


# Problem 182
A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.


# Problem 168
Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
you should return:

[[7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]]
Follow-up: What if you couldn't use any extra space?


# Problem 158
You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

Right, down, down, right
Down, right, down, right
The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.


# Problem 151
Given a 2-D matrix representing an image, a location of a pixel in the screen and a color C, replace the color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with C.

For example, given the following matrix, and location pixel of (2, 2), and 'G' for green:

B B W
W W W
W W W
B B B
Becomes

B B G
G G G
G G G
B B B


# Problem 136
Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[1, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 0]]
Return 4.


# Problem 122
You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. Assuming we start at matrix[0][0], and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

For example, in this matrix

0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 3 1
The most we can collect is 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins.


# Problem 84
Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

For example, this matrix has 4 islands.

1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1


# Problem 76
You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

cba
daf
ghi
This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

ca
df
gi
So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

abcdef
Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

zyx
wvu
tsr
Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.


# Problem 65
Given a N by M matrix of numbers, print out the matrix in a clockwise spiral.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
You should print out the following:

1
2
3
4
5
10
15
20
19
18
17
16
11
6
7
8
9
14
13
12


# Problem 63
Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.

For example, given the following matrix:

[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]
and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', you should return true, since it's the last row.


# Problem 62
There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

Right, then down
Down, then right
Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.


# Problem 56
Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix and an integer k, write a function to determine whether each vertex in the graph can be colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color using at most k colors.


# Problem 23
You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on.

Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of the board.

For example, given the following board:

[[f, f, f, f],
[t, t, f, t],
[f, f, f, f],
[f, f, f, f]]
and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.


# Problem 19
A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
