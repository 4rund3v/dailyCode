'''
A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors.
He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.
Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
