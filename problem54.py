"""
Sudoku is a puzzle where you're given a partially-filled 9 by 9 grid with digits.
The objective is to fill the grid with the constraint that every row, column, and box (3 by 3 subgrid) must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
Implement an efficient sudoku solver

    Sudoku can be solved using Backtracking.
    First, we'll iterate over the board to find a position where we need to
    insert a number from top-left.
    Once found, we find all the possibilities of this cell 
    i.e. numbers from 1-9 that do not exist in the block, row or column.
    Then we can add one of these to the board and recursively call the method
    with the new board.
    If we're able to find a solution i.e. all blocks are filled, we're done and
    we return the board as is.
    Else, we backtrack one step and try the next possibility for the cell.
